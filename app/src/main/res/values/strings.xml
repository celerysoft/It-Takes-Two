    <!-- Tutorial -->
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_0_text">Welcome to It Takes Two, the rule of the game is quite simple, After flipping one card, flip another card will start matching. Every time you match failed has a 2 points penalty. Matching same suit score 4 points, Matching same rank gain 16 points. Be careful, every flipping cost 1 point. So, let us begin, please flip first card.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_0_wrong_text">Please flip first card~</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_1_text">\nIt is a ♥️2, every time you flip a card cost 1 point, so your score now is -1. You certainly can not wait to turn the second card, but before your flipping, please flip over the first card. You have no idea what is the second card, if it could not match the first card, you will lost 2 points. So, please flip over the first card in the first place.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_1_wrong_text">Please flip over first card~</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_2_text">\nGood, first card is ♥️2, what about the second card? check it now!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_2_wrong_text">Let us check what second card is~</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_3_text">\nGreat,this is a ♥️6, with the same suit as first card, matching them will gain 4 points. We have noticed that it is the second time to flip a card, cost another point, so your score currently is -2. Now, turn the first card, get back all your lost.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_3_wrong_text">Flip first to match same suit~</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_4_text">\nGood job, the first card match the second card, could not flip any more. Your score is 1, suit matching received 4, flipping three times lost 3. You may think me as a noisy guy, but what I want to say is, you must exercise your own ability to remember cards, it will be best every card flipped only 1 time. Let us check the third card.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_4_wrong_text">It is time to flip third card~</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_5_text">\nThe third card is ♦️A, Now check the 4th card, see what will be happened. Flip over the third card, then turn the 4th card as before.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_5_wrong_text">Flip over third card before flipping 4th card~</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_6_text">\nGood, let ue see what 4th card is, flip it now.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_6_wrong_text">Why not flip 4th card～</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_7_text">\nWhat the hell! It is a ♠️A, having the same rank as the third card ♦️A, after matching you could get 16 points. Flip the third card to match quickly.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_7_wrong_text">What are you waiting for? flip third card to gain 16 points～</string>
    <string name="tutorial_last_process_8_text">\nHow do you feel of getting 16 points? In total, you flipped 6 times, cost 6 points, suit matching once, received 4 points and rank matching once got 16 points, so your final score is 14. Press any cards to continue…</string>
